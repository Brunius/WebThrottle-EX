In this release, we added more customization features, as well as tweaking the UI to make it easier to use.

__New Features:__
* Themes - You now have the option of simple, dark and metallic theme to choose from. They all look fabulous, but don't take our word for it, go check them out!
* More throttles - You now have the option to choose a knob speed controller, which goes well with the metallic theme.

__Fixes:__
* Different parts of the UI now disable depending if you have acquired a cab or connected to a command station

__Changed behavior:__
* The Emulator now issues responses to the commands sent to it
* The connect button now has an indicator for connection status
* There are more tooltips on various parts of the UI
* The enter key triggers the appropriate action in a text field (e.g. sending a command in the debug console).
* UI is now aligned with the center of the screen
* Other minor UI changes
